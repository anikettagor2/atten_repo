# Face-api.js Models

This directory should contain the face-api.js models. 

## Download Models

You need to download the models from the face-api.js repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights
2. Download the following model files:
   - `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json`
   - `tiny_face_detector_model-shard1`
   - `face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json`
   - `face_landmark_68_model-shard1`
   - `face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json`
   - `face_recognition_model-shard1`
   - `face_recognition_model-shard2`

3. Place all these files in this `public/models` directory

## Alternative: Use CDN

Alternatively, you can use a CDN version of the models by updating the MODEL_URL in the components to point to a CDN.
